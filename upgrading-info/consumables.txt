.tag:incense
Incense sticks are a consumable created by combining logs, ashes, and herbs. They have a variety of uses between skilling and combat, but we will only be covering those that have a pvm related boost. Each incense stick increases the buff duration by 10 minutes.
Incense sticks have a potency from 1-4. This increases by 1 every 10 minutes (30 minutes till max potency), or you can 'overload' and instantly boost to max potency at the cost of 6 sticks (still only 10 minutes added duration though). This would increase the cost for 1 hour to 11 incense sticks instead of just 6, but more sticks can be added to keep the boosts up indefinitely assuming your buff doesn't expire. Dying will cancel your incense boost as a whole causing you to have to re-incense, even if you use a ring of death or practice mode. In practice, overloading instantly is almost always better.
You can have up to 3 different effects active at once at 95 firemaking.
The relevant incense sticks with pvm benefits are listed as follows:
<:bp:641305524884733970> Ranarr: Each potency level gives a +1 prayer bonus (functionally useless)
<:bp:641305524884733970> Spirit Weed: Each potency level provides a 10% increased familiar special attack recovery rate
<:bp:641305524884733970> Irit: Each potency level reduces poison damage by 25%
<:bp:641305524884733970> Kwuarm: Each potency level provides +2.5% weapon poison damage
<:bp:641305524884733970> Lantadyme: Each potency level increases potion timer by 30 seconds. Not usually cost effective to use but can reduce the need to make more overloads.
<:bp:641305524884733970> Fellstalk (For Slayer): Each potency level provides a x1.01 chance to spawn elite monsters

Incense sticks are rather expensive to use in dangerous pvm due to having to re-incense upon death, so it is advised to only use them in higher level pvm where there benefits are quite tangible for their value or where their cost will be offset by profit. But here is a general list of where you would use certain incense sticks.

**Nex:** Lantadyme
**Kalphite King:** Spirit Weed, Kwuarm, Lantadyme
**GWD2:** Spirit Weed, Kwuarm (at Helwyr and Greg), Lantadyme, Irit (At Greg)
**Elite Dungeons:** Spirit Weed, Kwuarm, Lantadyme
**Angel of Death:** Spirit Weed, Kwuarm, Lantadyme
**Araxxor:** Lantadyme, Irit if not using salves/venomblood
**Raids:** Spirit Weed, Kwuarm, Lantadyme
**Magister:** Spirit Weed, Kwuarm, Lantadyme
**Rots:** Lantadyme
**Solak:** Spirit Weed, Kwuarm, Lantadyme
