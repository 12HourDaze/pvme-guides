<:torvabody:643166871285137458> **T80 Armour**
<:bp:641305524884733970> The standard armour for all PvMing
      • Note: Should just opt for Masterwork over Torva due to costs
<:bp:641305524884733970> Priority: `High`
_ _
.
<:masterworkbody:643847056527458324> **T90 Armour**
<:bp:641305524884733970> Better defensive bonuses, as well as marginal dps increase to t80 armor

.
<:tmwbody:536966366272552960> **T92 Armour**
<:bp:641305524884733970> The best armor. Relatively small defense and dps boost vs t90 armor
      • Note: Due to costs none are worth using outside of Elite Dungeons except for Trimmed Masterwork
      • Note: TMW effect and low cost is what makes it worthwhile
        - When wearing 3+ pieces you will gain x*10% damage soak that will be applied as a DoT where x is number of pieces worn. If 3 pieces it is 30%
        - Note: Reduces damage of veng recoil, and can negatively impact reprisals at bosses like Vorago, because it reduces the damage taken in and used by reprisal for things such as TS explosion
<:bp:641305524884733970> Priority: `Low`

<:bp:641305524884733970> Note: In general dw camp > 2h camp at bosses due to marginally better single target dps along with the fact it makes shield/flank/lunging switches easier and more fluid to use. Optimally you should use both weapons however.
