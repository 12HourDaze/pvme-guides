> **Introduction**
Generally, Barrows is only camped by high level players in an effort to obtain the Graverobber title. Since the brothers are relatively weak, soul split is used to avoid the need for solid food. Bring hybrid armor and two combat styles, since Akrisae is able to prayer switch to block your prayers. Additionally, having obtained Morytania Legs 3+ is useful and increases loot obtained. A Drakan's medallion is used to initially teleport to the Barrows, as high level players are able to camp the boss for hours on end, reducing the need to retune your Max Guild portal. Overloads, Weapon Poison, and Replenishment Potions are all used in order to provide flat damage increases, making your runs faster.

The brothers should be killed in the following order:

Dharok <:next:536014182626099201> Guthan <:next:536014182626099201> Verac <:next:536014182626099201> Akrisae <:next:536014182626099201> Ahrim <:next:536014182626099201> Linza <:next:536014182626099201> Karil <:next:536014182626099201> Torag
.
Use your amulet on Akrisae, and on the 2/3 bottom crypts.

If you encounter Akrisae in the tunnels, he can be one shot before he's able to prayer switch by doing the following:

<:AirSurge:543465115870035999> + <:deto:535533833358016512> + <:wm:535533809978966037>

Generally, Barrows will scale to the level of effort willing to be put in. For example, it is possible to 4taa the brothers, and use dw/2h switching in order to clear them quickly. However, it is also reasonable to bring less switches and instead take a more relaxed approach, using legacy to AFK the brothers or revolution to clear them, only having to switch styles on Akrisae in response to his prayers.
