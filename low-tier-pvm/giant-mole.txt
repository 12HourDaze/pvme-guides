> **Introduction**
Another old boss, only camped for pet and title. Giant mole is very straightforward, only requiring the ability to do damage. The only relevant mechanic preset is his dig, where he will dig to a different part of the arena, indicated by a dirt arrow on the ground. Falador Hard and Elite diaries provide buffs to the rewards from mole, but these are minimal, and not required for camping the boss. <:soulsplit:615613924506599497> can be used to mitigate any damage done by the Mole.
