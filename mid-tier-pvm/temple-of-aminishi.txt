**__Sanctum Guardian__**

Stand to the north of the crab and DPS. Meleers should stand south, otherwise AoEs will not work (<:cleave:535532878616985610>, <:gflurry:535532879283879977>, <:vulnbomb:655341074235129858>). You can dodge the ranged attacks by running 2 squares, but it is not necessary. If you're in melee distance, it will melee you instead. The pattern is 4 attacks -> melee bubble -> attack -> water gun -> attack -> purple poison -> attack -> melee bubble -> attack -> water gun -> etc.

The water gun will shoot directly north. To avoid it, stand to the east and then run to the west after it has fired. You will avoid it completely. For melee, the watergun can be dodged with a well-timed Bladed Dive or Disruption shield (these two can be done losslessly) or Resonance

Afterwards Sanctum will put purple poison on you, indicated by the bar. Place these towards the outer edges of the arena. You will get melee bubble while placing so flick appropriately. 

Sanctum will continue to cycle through with water guns and purple poisons. Repeat until dead.

Alternatively, you may use a fishy treat after tagging it to completely skip the fight.

**__Masuta, the Ascended__**

.
__Phase 1 (550k - 275k)__

Masuta will mainly melee you, but will occasionally use ranged attacks instead. His attack rotation consists of attacks -> spin -> attacks -> tsunami -> repeat. During these attacks, Masuta can summon untargetable clones that will also deal melee damage. It is possible to poison and kill these. He can also do pulverize - simply move out of the way (or under him) to avoid damage.

.
To avoid the spin, lure Masuta to one side and then surge to the other. You can <:soulsplit:534810844559835136> this attack. For melee, <:devo:513190158728953857> + <:DeflectMelee:544195488447201300> will block most of the damage

To avoid the tsunami, simply surge across the stairs right before the attack happens.

Start by using thresholds and then kite Masuta as he spins. Use your DPS ultimate on the other side of the stairs - you should be able to use up at least half of your ultimate before tsunami spec. Surge away and return back to your ultimate. Repeat the process until phase. For melee, start off with <:zerk:535532854004678657> + <:overkill:651070677582872578> -> thresholds. The time Masuta starts his spin attack is random, so be ready to cast Devotion when necessary. Continue with <:zgs:626465964325601290> <:spec:537340400273195028> + <:limitless:641339233638023179>, this should consistantly phase into p2 with only one spin. Should damage be insufficient and a second spin attack occurs, surge/bd away and wait it out

__Phase 2 (275k - 0)__

For the first part, 15 thrashing waters will spawn. Use surge/bladed dive to kill them asap. Preferably within 2 squares of them to receive damage reduction on Masuta's magic attacks.

Once the final thrashing water has spawned, Masuta will become attackable again. He will mainly use ranged attacks, but will occasionally use the high-hitting tsunami attack. Simply flick to mage pray or use defensives to mitigate it. This is a DPS phase, so just hit him until he dies. The further away you stand, the longer his tsunami travel time is, so take advantage of that. In melee distance, Masuta's tsunami will actually hit 1 tick earlier than a ranged attack launched at the same time would, so you can pray <:soulsplit:534810844559835136> > <:soulsplit:534810844559835136> > <:DeflectMage:544195487926845462> > <:DeflectRange:544195488317046812> > repeat and you will correctly pray against whatever attack is used at the time
.
**__Seiryu, the Azure Serpent__**

.
__Fighting the head (total damage of 300k dealt per cycle)__

All you have to do is lower Seiryu from 7.5m to 7.2m. Start off by using a DPS ultimate. His attacks will either be a magic attack or a shadow tendril attack - move to dodge the latter. He will cycle specials like this: attacks -> huge breath -> attacks -> glowing energy -> repeat. During the fight, Seiryu will also summon lines of black hands across the arena. Simply move away from those.

For the huge breath, resonance/disruption should be used against it, if neither of those are off cooldown you may use debilitate/devotion but this is not recommended as you can easily soul split flick and restore any life points you may have lost.

For the glowing energy, keep in mind where the arrow is. It will fire shadow hands at your location, so simply move away to avoid it.

Keep hitting it until 7.2m (it is possible to flank Seiryu be standing on either side of his head), Then climb up either side of the shackles.

.
__Fighting the black crystals (150k each)__

Do a planted feet ultimate on the first crystal. Stay on top and ignore the shadow enigmas. Kill it, eat to full, wait until after the 4th uber heal, plant your 2 mines and start your onslaught and try to get 10-11 hits in. When you're dragged down, use Freedom and AoEs to tag the shadow enigmas. Continue the ground portion as usual.

On the second cycle, do an ultimate without planted feet and use 2 mines on the other crystal, kill it and then jump down to kill the shadow enigmas. Climb back up, use dominion mines on the last crystal, and either onslaught/zerk/meta will work to bring down the final crystal.

If using melee, <:zerk:535532854004678657> + <:overkill:651070677582872578> the first crystal and make sure to bleed maul <:assault:535532853979512842> -> dw <:destroy:535532879330148352>. Continue your zerk rotation to finish the first crystal, ignore any shadow enigmas. You can use mutated flurry to lower your zerk cooldown, once the 4th uber heal has happened <:zerk:535532854004678657> -> <:gbarge:535532879250456578> + dom mine -> <:limitless:641339233638023179> + maul <:assault:535532853979512842> bleed -> dw <:destroy:535532879330148352>. This should consistenly lower the 2nd crystal to 20-30k lifepoints.

On the second cycle, go up the other side and <:zerk:535532854004678657> -> <:gbarge:535532879250456578> + dom mine -> maul <:assault:535532853979512842> -> dw <:destroy:535532879330148352> -> improvise until the crystal is destroyed. The middle crystal should then already be low enough, you can onslaught or just use some basics + thresholds for a very easy 2 cycle.
